Glory be to God!!!

I was able to finish this, struggled a bit.

This my biggest project till date, I got to learn a lot about how to utilize flexbox and how to properly position elements, I also got to learn a little bit about DOM manipulation and website responsiveness.

This project however has quite some number of hairballs and bugs, By God's grace I'll get better at writing css....

Here's a few of them bugs:
1. The hidden menu dosen't cover the entire right side of the viewport when it's clicked (On Mobile).
2. Some elements kinda look funny
3. I ran into unecessary problems while trying to deploy it on Github pages, but it was all smooth on netlify
