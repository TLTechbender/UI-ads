Glory be to God!!!

I was able to finish this, struggled a bit.

This my biggest project till date, I got to learn a lot about how to utilize flexbox and how to properly position elements, I also got to learn a little bit about DOM manipulation and website responsiveness.

This project however has quite some number of hairballs and bugs, By God's grace I'll get better at writing css....

Here's a few of them bugs:
1. The hidden menu dosen't cover the entire right side of the viewport when it's clicked (On Mobile).
2. Some elements kinda look funny
3. I ran into unecessary problems while trying to deploy it on Github pages, but it was all smooth on netlify
4. An Overflow-x bug on PC
5. Transition effects don't align properly on mobile in the campuses container
6. When the side Menu is open on Mobile, the site is still scrollable.

I hope they get resolved soon.
